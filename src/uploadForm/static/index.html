      <h1 class="text-center">Hello, Employers!</h1>
      <p>You know when you post a job, and dozens, maybe hundreds of applicants respond for one role? One person eventually gets the job, but by then you just can't be bothered to reply to the other applicants that that position is no longer available.</p>
      <p>The decent thing would be to shoot a short email saying, "Sorry friend, but the position is filled. Good luck!" But who's got time for that? I mean, it would take literally 15 seconds of your day, but that Twitter feed ain't gonna scroll itself!</p>
      <p>That's where LYCD comes in! Just fill out the form below with your email address and a comma-separated list of applicant email addresses, and we'll send them a nice email politely asking them to move on in their job search. You get to do the decent thing, and they get to sleep at night. Win-win!</p>
      <p>To use LYCD, fill out the form below and hit the button. It is <em>literally</em> the least you can do.</p>
